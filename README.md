# Front-end
Repository for all my front-end projects

20.06.23 I just start my way to my dream.
05.07.23 I have almost completly figured out HTML5 markup and how to use the CSS tool. I have made several layouts to check my knowledge, and in the end - pretty good pumped my dev skills. There are still to learn some grid features, and i want to strengthen my knowledge of adaptive layout.
